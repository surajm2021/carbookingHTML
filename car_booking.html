The BMW 7 Series has gone under the scalpel big time. Big being the operative word, since it is in fact, much more than a facelift. It has that really impressive massive front grille and BMW logo and an increased amount of sophistication and sleekness in its design - both in the metal and in its lighting systems. And now the car has arrived in India. Prices start from ₹ 1.22 crore for the 730Ld design pure excellence trim and go all the way to ₹ 2.42 crore for the top-of-the-line M760Li xDrive model. Now the three diesel engine variants along with the smaller petrol engine model are assembled in Chennai while the 745Le xDrive plug-in hybrid model and the M760Li xDrive are imported as completely built units and it is the 745Le xDrive plug-in hybrid that we drove!
